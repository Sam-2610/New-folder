<!-- Continuing from exercise 6d, let's say the discount is only available
if it is not a holiday. Create a variable: const isHoliday = true;
Update the code so that in order to get a discount, people must
meet the age requirement and it is also not a holiday.
• Note: && has a higher priority than II so you may need to use
brackets () to control which code gets done first.
• Try changing the value of isHoliday to display different messages. -->
